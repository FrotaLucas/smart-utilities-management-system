## Project Title

### Smart Utilities Management System

Mission

To streamline the management of utilities (gas, water, and electricity) by providing companies with a comprehensive overview of their client base and individual consumption patterns.

Description

This full-stack application allows Smart Utilities to record and monitor client utility data via a RESTful API, supporting the full lifecycle of client and reading data management.

### Update Customer Screen
Allows editing customer information such as name, family name and birthdate.

### Add New Reading Screen
Interface to record a new reading value. If the customer does not exist, a popup will be displayed.

## 2. Architecture

### REST API Architecture

The application adheres to REST (Representational State Transfer) principles, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

### Key Characteristics of REST:

**1. Statelessness**: Each request from the client must contain all the information needed to process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests, enhancing scalability and reliability.

**2. Client-Server Architecture**: Separates the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, allowing the client and server to evolve independently.

**3. Uniform Interface**: Defines a standardized way of communicating between client and server. Standard URIs for Resource Identification, a consistent representation of messages (such as JSON or XML), and the use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) according to RESTful principles ensure a uniform and scalable API design.

**4. Layered System**:  RESTful arquitecture are built in hierarchical layers, allowing components to operate independently. Client â†’ Proxy or Cache â†’ Load Balancer â†’ Backend Server.

**5. Cacheability**: The server can indicate whether a response is cacheable by the browser (e.g., using headers like Cache-Control: max-age=3600 or Expires: [date]). This allows the browser to retrieve data from the cache, reducing latency and improving performance.

### Technologies Used

#### Backend
- **Framework**: Jersey for building API RESTful and configuring the HTTP Server manually, Jakarta is used for annotations such as @PATH/@GET, Jackson handles JSON serialization, and Maven for dependency management and project execution.
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
> *I chose not to use Spring in order to get a deep understanding by manually configuring HTTP server and the JSON serialization processes.* <

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: [Angular](https://angular.io/) with [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  

#### Database
- **System**: MariaDB  

#### Tools
- **API Testing**: Postman  
- **Version Control**: Git  

## 3. Software Setup & Usage

### Technology Roles

- **MariaDB**: An open-source relational database management system, used to store and manage application data.

- **Apache Maven 3.9.9**: A build automation tool primarily for Java projects, managing project dependencies and build lifecycle.

- **Java HotSpotâ„¢ 21.0**: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation used to run Java applications.

- **Postman**: An API client used for testing and documenting APIs.

- **Visual Studio Code**: A lightweight but powerful source code editor, ideal for frontend development.

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: An integrated development environment (IDE) for Java development.

- **Git**: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

Notes:
Relationship
1. Relationship: One-to-Many (One Customer can have multiple Readings).
2. Key caractheristics of Entitieas: optional to optional. 
> *Note: customer can exist without being linked to reading and reading can have its customer_id set to null* <

## 5. Testing Strategy

### Technologies

- **JUnit**: A unit testing framework for Java, allowing developers to write and run repeatable tests.

- **Rest Assured**: A Java library for testing RESTful web services, simplifying the validation of responses.

### Test Execution Commands

- **Run all tests**:  
  Execute `mvn test`.

- **Run a specific test class**:  
  Use `mvn -Dtest=MyClassOfTests test`.

- **Run a specific test method**:  
  Execute `mvn -Dtest=MyClassOfTests#myMethod test`.
